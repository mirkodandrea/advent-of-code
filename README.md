# Advent of Code 2022

Ho ho ho! Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2022!

Inside, you'll find a sleigh-load of elf-approved solutions to the daily challenges. Each day's challenges are stored in a subfolder named aoc-ddx, where dd is the day from 1 to 25 and x is a or b.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and run the exercises in this repository, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the desired day's subfolder (e.g. `aoc-01a`)
- Compile the project using `cargo build`
- Run the project using `cargo run`


Happy coding and have a holly jolly Christmas!
